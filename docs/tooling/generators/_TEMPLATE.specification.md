# {Name} Specification

**Purpose:** Describe how this generated instance specializes the parent primitive spec. Keep it concise; reference the parent for anything already covered there.

> Use this as guidance, not a rigid form. Capture the *deltas* from the parent specification.

## How to Read the Parent, Then Specialize Locally
- Read the parent spec: `docs/ddd-implementation/primitives/{primitive}/specification.md`.
- List only what is unique for this instance: fields, invariants, integrations, lifecycle quirks.
- If something is identical to the parent, don’t restate it—just omit.

## What It Is (1–2 sentences)
- [FILL IN: What this specific {primitive} represents]
- [FILL IN: Why it exists in this context]

## Deltas From Parent Contract
- Inputs/fields that are **special** here (or have special meaning)
- Outputs/result shape differences (if any)
- Error cases that are unique to this instance

## Invariants That Matter Here
- [FILL IN: Only the invariants that are specific/critical for this instance]

## Side Effects / Integrations
- Events emitted (if any) that are specific to this instance
- External systems that rely on its shape/fields

## Callers and Consumers (Only the concrete ones)
- Callers: [FILL IN: which handlers/use cases create/use this]
- Consumers: [FILL IN: who reads its events/outputs]

## Lifecycle Notes (Only if different from parent)
- Creation: any special factory details?
- Serialization: anything special to preserve?
- Idempotency/versioning: any instance-specific needs?
